Procedural programming:
This type of programming is derived from structural 
programming where large problems are decomposed in 
to smaller sub-problems and each sub problem is 
expressed as a procedure and each procedure can be 
called from a main program.  Unlike imperative 
programming, procedural programming relies on blocks 
of code and scope of variables to make it easier to read 
and debug.

Modularity and reusabilty of code are important aspects
of procedural programming.

One key factor which differentiates procedural from 
functional programming is side effects.
Side effects: 
A function is said to have a side effect if apart from 
returning a value from the function it also does 
something outside of its scope such as writing to a file 
or printing a character to a screen.  Most programs need 
to use side effects to make them practical.
Changing the start of a value outside the scope of a 
function can make programs difficult to maintain.
We will look at some example of side effects to illustrate 
these points.
