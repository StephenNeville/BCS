There are many different programming paradigms or ways of programming. 
I am going to discuss 3 types:

* procedural 
* functional 
* object oriented.

Python can be programmed in any of these styles. It is effectively
 a multiparadigm language. I will attempt to use program examples 
which highlight key features of this programming styles


"A paradigm is a way of doing something (like programming), not a 
concrete thing (like a language). Now, it’s true that if a programming
 language L happens to make a particular programming paradigm P easy to express, 
then we often say “L is a P language” (e.g. “Haskell is a functional 
programming language”) but that does not mean there is any such thing as a
 “functional language paradigm”.
