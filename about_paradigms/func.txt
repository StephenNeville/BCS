Functional programming.
This is a structured programming language and the main 
difference between a functional and procedural 
paradigm is that this type of programming attempts to 
avoids side effects. It will tend to express programs as 
pure functions. It relies heavily on first class functions. It 
supports passing functions as arguments to other 
functions and returning them as the values from other 
functions. These values are assigned to variables or 
stored to data structures.  In Python, MAP is an example 
of a first class function which takes as its argument, a 
function and a list, and returns a list formed by applying 
the function to each member of the list.
We will look at an example of a program using the MAP 
function
